
<------------------------------------Introduction To Java Method------------------------------------>
The method in Java is a collection of instructions that performs a specific task. It provides the reusability of code. 
We can also easily modify code using methods. Methods are used to perform certain actions, and they are also known as functions.
The most important method in Java is the main() method.

1) Why use Method?
=> To reuse code: define the code once, and use it many times.

<------------------------------------Create a Java Method------------------------------------>
=> A method must be declared within a class. It is defined with the name of the method, followed by parentheses (). 
Java provides some pre-defined methods, such as System.out.println(), but you can also create your own methods to perform 
certain actions:

eg:
public class Main {
  static void myMethod() {
    // code to be executed
  }
}

Example Explained
a) myMethod() is the name of the method
b) static means that the method belongs to the Main class and not an object of the Main class. 
c) void means that this method does not have a return value. You will learn more about return values later in this chapter

<------------------------------------Call a Java Method------------------------------------>
=>To call a method in Java, write the method's name followed by two parentheses () and a semicolon;
In the following example, myMethod() is used to print a text (the action), when it is called:

eg:
public class Main {
  static void myMethod() {
    System.out.println("I just got executed!");
    //the output will be "I just got executed!" 3 time as it is called 3 time below.
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    myMethod();
    myMethod();
    myMethod();
  }
}
