<------------------------------------Introduction of Loops In Java------------------------------------>
=> There are mainly 3 types of loops in Java.

1) for loop
=> The Java for loop is used to repeat a part of your program multiple times. 
If you know exactly how many times you want to repeat something, it's best to use a for loop.

How a For Loop Works:
a) Initialization: Set a starting point.
b) Condition: Decide when to stop.
c) Update: Move to the next step.

eg:
for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    System.out.println(i);
    /* The loop will print
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5*/
}
Explanation:
i) Initialization (int i = 1): Start with i equal to 1.
ii) Condition (i <= 5): Keep going as long as i is 5 or less.
iii) Update (i++): Increase i by 1 each time.

2) while loops 
=> The Java while loop repeats a part of your program as long as a condition is true. When the 
condition becomes false, the loop stops.

How a While Loop Works:
a) Condition: The loop checks if something is true.
b) Repeat: If it’s true, the loop runs the code inside.
c) Stop: When it’s false, the loop stops.

eg:
int i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
    /* The loop will print
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5*/
}

Explanation:
i) Condition (i <= 5): The loop checks if i is 5 or less.
ii) Repeat: As long as i is 5 or less, the loop prints i and then increases i by 1.
iii) Stop: When i becomes greater than 5, the loop stops.

3) do-while loop
=> The Java do-while loop repeats a part of your program until a condition is true. 
Unlike other loops, it always runs the code inside at least once because it checks the 
condition after the code runs.

How a Do-While Loop Works:
a) Run the Code: The loop runs the code inside.
b) Condition: After running the code, the loop checks if something is true.
c) Repeat or Stop: If it’s true, the loop repeats. If it’s false, the loop stops.

eg:
int i = 1;
do {
    System.out.println(i);
    i++;
    /* The loop will print
    1
    2
    3
    4
    5*/
} while (i <= 5);

Explanation:
i) Run the Code: The loop starts by printing i and then increasing i by 1.
ii) Condition (i <= 5): After running the code, the loop checks if i is 5 or less.
iii) Repeat or Stop: If i is 5 or less, the loop runs again. If i is greater than 5, the loop stop
