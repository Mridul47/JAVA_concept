<------------------------------------Java if-else Statement------------------------------------>
=> The if-else statement in java is used to test the conditions. It checks boolean condition. 
i.e. true or false. There are various types of if statement in java. Some of them are listed below

1) Java if Statement
The Java if statement tests the condition. It executes the if block if condition is true.

eg: 
if(condition){
    //write code here
}

Code snippet in: (/JavaProject/src/JavaIfConditional.java)

2) if-else statement
=> This is also used for testing the conditions. It executes the "if" block if condition is true
otherwise "else" block is executed.

eg:
if(condition){
    //write code here if the condition is true
}else{
    //write code here if the condition is false
}

Code snippet in: (/JavaProject/src/JavaIfelseCondition.java)

3) if- else if -if ladder
=> This statement executes one condition from multiple statements.

eg:
if(condition){
    //executes code here if condition1 is true
}else if{
    //executes code here if condition2 is true
}else if{
    //executes code here if condition3 is true
}else{
    //executes code here if all conditions are false
}

Code snippet in: (/JavaProject/src/Java_If_ElseIf_IfConditional.java)

4) Nested if statement
=> This statement represents "if" block within/inside the another "if" block from outside.
In this scenario, the inner "if" block executes only when the outer "if" block condition is
true.

eg:
if(condition){
    //execute code here
    if(condition){
        //execute code here.
    }
}

Code snippet in: (/JavaProject/src/NestedIfConditionals.java)

<------------------------------------Using Ternary Operator------------------------------------>
=> We can also use ternary operator (? :) to perform the task of if...else statement. 
It is a shorthand way to check the condition. If the condition is true, the result of ? is returned. 
But, if the condition is false, the result of : is returned.

eg: 
public class IfElseTernaryExample {    
public static void main(String[] args) {    
    int number=13;    
    //Using ternary operator  
    String output=(number%2==0)?"even number":"odd number";    
    System.out.println(output);  
}    
}
