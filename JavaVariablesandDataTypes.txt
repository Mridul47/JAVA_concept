<------------------------------------Variables in Java------------------------------------>
=> Variable in Java is a data container that stores the data values during Java program execution. 
Every variable is assigned data type which designates the type and quantity of value it can hold. 
Variable is a memory location name of the data.
There are 3 variable types.
1) Local Variable
=> A variable declared inside the body of the method is called local variable. This Variable can only
be used  within the method. The other methods within the class aren't even aware of this variable whether
it exists or not.
A local variable cannot be defined with "static" keyword.
eg:
public class A  
{  
    void method()  // it is inside the method as given above
    {    
        int n=90;//local variable    
    }  
    public static void main(String args[])  
    {  
        // remaining code  
    }  
}//end of class   


2) Instance Variable
=> A variable declared inside the class but outside the body of the method is instance variable.
It is not declared as static.
It is called an instance variable because its value is instance-specific and is not shared among instances.
eg:
public class A{
    public static void main(String args[])  
    {  
        int data=50;//instance variable    
    }  
}//end of class 

3) Static Variable 
=> A variable that is declared as static is called a static variable. It cannot be local. You can create a 
single copy of the static variable and share it among all the instances of the class. Memory allocation for 
static variables happens only once when the class is loaded in the memory.
eg:
public class A  
{  
    static int m=100;//static variable  
    public static void main(String args[])  
    {  
           / remaining code
    }  
}/


OVERALL EXAMPLE:
public class A  
{  
    static int m=100;//static variable  
    void method()  
    {    
        int n=90;//local variable    
    }  
    public static void main(String args[])  
    {  
        int data=50;//instance variable    
    }  
}//end of class
